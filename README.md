# Image Builder

This repository contains the image builder for the volkszaehler raspbian image.

It is based on [pi-gen](https://github.com/RPi-Distro/pi-gen). For usage instructions please refer to the [pi-gen](https://github.com/RPi-Distro/pi-gen) documentation.

Currently dockerized build is not supported. Instead, it is suggested to run the build process on an actual Raspberry Pi.

The current image can be downloaded from the [wiki](https://wiki.volkszaehler.org/howto/raspberry_pi_image#image_aufspielen).
